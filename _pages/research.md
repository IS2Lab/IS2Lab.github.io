# Research

<!-- We seek to do cutting-edge, high-quality, and impactful research combining theory and practice. As such,  -->
<!-- We are closely collaborating with our industrial partners including Huawei, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group to solve real-world challenging problems in an effective and scalable way. Some of our recent projects are as follows. -->

<br>
*We are grateful to conduct research supported by NSFC, ZJU and multiple industrial partners including Huawei, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group. Some of our recent projects are as follows.*  

<!-- Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on: -->

<!-- ### ✅ Deep Learning System Security -->
<br>

##### 😊 **[ICSE 21, TACAS 21, ISSTA 21, ASE 20, ICECCS 20, ICSE 19]: Testing, Verifying and Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Learning Models**
We are building systematic methodologies and toolkits including novel testing metrics correlated to robustness, test case generation methods, automatic verification and repair techniques to comprehensively test, verify and enhance the robustness of deep learning models deployed in various application scenarios, e.g., image classification, object detection and NLP.

##### 😊 **[ICSE 22, TSE 21, ICSE 20]: Testing, Interpreting and Mitigating the Hidden Bias in Deep Learning**

We are building systematic fairness testing methodologies and toolkits specially designed for efficiently uncover, inteprete and mitigate various kinds of bias, e.g., individual discrimination and group discrimination, in deep learning models deployed in Alibaba's recommender system serving millions of people.

<br>
**Object Detection System Security Testing.** By generating multiple test cases to expose the security vulnerablities of the object detection system, and designing test metrics to evaluate the security and robustness of the object detection system, finally we can build more security and more robust OD systems by retraining.
