# Research

We seek to do cutting-edge, high-quality, and impactful research combining theory and practice. As such, we are closely collaborating with our industrial partners including Huawei, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group to solve real-world challenging problems in an effective and scalable way.

<!-- Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

<br>
**DL Copyright Protection.** We are building a DL model copyright protection frame based on the idea of testing, aiming to prove accurate and robust model copyright verifications.

<br>
**NN Repair.** We are building a NN(especially RNN) repair framework, aiming to repair incorrect behaviors provably.

<br>
**Object Detection System Security Testing.** By generating multiple test cases to expose the security vulnerablities of the object detection system, and designing test metrics to evaluate the security and robustness of the object detection system, finally we can build more security and more robust OD systems by retraining.

<br>
**DL Recommender System Fairness Testing:** We are building a DL recommender system testing framework to identify unfairness and find disadvantaged groups to improve the fairness of the original model.

<br>
**DL Robustness Testing.** We are building a DL testing framework that aims to enhance the model robustness against various attacks in a one-step way.

<br>
**Certifiable Machine Unlearning.** We are building a certifiable machine unlearning framework that aims to guarantee the data to be forgotten and not damage model's performance.
