# Research

<!-- We seek to do cutting-edge, high-quality, and impactful research combining theory and practice. As such,  -->
<!-- We are closely collaborating with our industrial partners including Huawei, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group to solve real-world challenging problems in an effective and scalable way. Some of our recent projects are as follows. -->

<br>
*We are grateful to conduct research sponsored by NSFC, CCF and multiple industrial partners including Huawei, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group. Recently, we are mainly working on the following exciting research themes.*  

<!-- Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on: -->
<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ### âœ… Deep Learning System Security -->
<br>

#### ***Theme 1: Testing, Verification and Repair of AI Models or AI-based Systems***
<!-- **[TOSEM 22, ICSE 21, TACAS 21, ISSTA 21, ASE 20, ICECCS 20, ICSE 19]: Testing, Verifying and Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Learning Models** -->

For AI models (e.g., large language models or deep learning models in general) or AI-based systems (e.g., autonomous cars), we are working towards *a systematic testing>verification>repair loop to comprehensively and automatically evaluate, identify and fix the potential risks hidden in multiple dimensions, e.g., robustness, fairness, safety and copyright.* This line of research is crucial for human beings to be aware of, manage and mitigate the risks in the emergence of diverse AI models and AI-based systems.  

<!-- including novel testing metrics correlated to robustness, test case generation methods, automatic verification and repair techniques to comprehensively test, verify and enhance the robustness of deep learning models deployed in various application scenarios, e.g., image classification, object detection and NLP. -->

#### ***Theme 2: System Software Testing or Verification for Industrial Safety-critical Systems***
<!-- **[TOSEM 22, ICSE 21, TACAS 21, ISSTA 21, ASE 20, ICECCS 20, ICSE 19]: Testing, Verifying and Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Learning Models** -->

Software is the core driving force for the digital operation of industrial safety-critical systems (industrial control systems, autonomous systems, etc). It is thus crucial to formally verify the correctness of their software foundations (e.g., OS kernel, compilers, security protocols or control programs) for industrial safety-critical systems. In this line of research, we are working on *developing new logic foundations and specifications to better model, test and verify the desired safety or security properties in different system software layers (especially those commonly used in safety-critical industries).*   
<!-- We are building systematic methodologies and toolkits including novel testing metrics correlated to robustness, test case generation methods, automatic verification and repair techniques to comprehensively test, verify and enhance the robustness of deep learning models deployed in various application scenarios, e.g., image classification, object detection and NLP. -->
