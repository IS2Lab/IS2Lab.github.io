**About** The *Intelligent System Security (IS2) Lab* is a research group led by [Prof. Jingyi Wang](https://wang-jingyi.github.io/) affiliated with the College of Control Science and Engineering, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), Hangzhou, China. Our lab's research focuses on ***formal trust assurance of complex intelligent systems integrating software, AI and control***. The detailed research topics include:
<!-- developing principled methodologies towards building more trustworthy  -->
<!-- AI models/systems/applications and more secure systems. -->
<!-- developing novel software engineering techniques towards building more trustworthy AI or more secure systems and software. -->
<!-- lie in the intersection of formal methods, software engineering, artificial intelligence (AI) and safety/security. Specifically, we aim to develop novel software engineering techniques (often from a formal methods perspective) towards building more trustworthy AI-based or safety-critical industrial systems or software. -->
<!-- *provide certifiable (and ideally provable) reliability or security guarantees for practical intelligent or distributed systems* like autonomous driving car, industrial control system, blockchain system, etc. -->
<!-- Specifically, we are working on the following existing research topics: -->
- Formal modeling and reasoning of safety and security;
- Testing, verification and repair of AI models or AI-enabled systems/applications;
- AI safety, security and ethics, e.g., for LLMs, agents and embodied intelligence.

**Collaborations** We aim to conduct research with practical relevance and impact by working closely with our industrial partners like Huawei, Alibaba, Ant Group, UWinTech, etc. We are also actively collaborating with top universities like ETH, UC Berkeley, UIUC, University of Manchester, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, etc. 
<!-- Moreover, we are also working closely with our industrial partners like Huawei, Alibaba and Ant Group to tackle real-world challenges.  -->


**Vacancies** We are always actively looking for self-motivated PostDoc/PhD/master/research assistants/research interns with competitive packages to work with us at ZJU. Feel free to contact Prof. Wang with CV (and transcript for PhD/Master applications) if you are interested. We welcome candidates from diverse background to apply.
<!-- Preferred PhD candidates should be good at programming or maths, and more importantly love doing research.  -->
<!-- For ZJU students, kindly check out my Google Calendar if you wish to have a talk. -->

<!-- To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**


We are grateful for funding from Leiden University, [NWO](www.nwo.nl) ([Vidi talent scheme](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme) and the [Frontiers in Nanoscience program](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/science/frontiers-of-nanoscience-nanofront)), and from an [ERC starting grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants). -->
