I"ö<p><strong>About</strong> The <em>Intelligent System Security (IS2) Lab</em> is a research lab led by <a href="https://wang-jingyi.github.io/">Prof. Jingyi Wang</a> affiliated with the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. The goal of our labâ€™s research is to develop novel software engineering (or formal methods) methodologies towards building more trustworthy systems or software.
<!-- *provide certifiable (and ideally provable) reliability or security guarantees for practical intelligent or distributed systems* like autonomous driving car, industrial control system, blockchain system, etc. -->
In particular, we are working on the following exiciting research topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quality assurance/certification (testing, verification and repair, etc) of AI or AI-based systems;</li>
  <li>Safety and security of LLMs or LLM-based systems;</li>
  <li>Verification of concurrent (reactive) systems, e.g., OS kernels and distributed control systems;</li>
  <li>Verification of security protocols;</li>
  <li>Other related topics like fuzzing, symbolic execution, runtime verification, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Collaborations</strong> Our lab has established active collaborations with top universities like ETH, UC Berkeley, UIUC, National University of Singapore, etc. Moreover, we are also working closely with our industrial partners like Huawei, Alibaba and Ant Group to tackle real-world reliability and security challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Vacencies</strong> Our lab is always actively looking for self-motivated PostDoc/PhD/master/research assistants/research interns with competitive packages to join our group at ZJU to work on any of the above topics. Feel free to contact Prof. Wang with CV (and transcript for PhD/Master applications) if you are interested. 
<!-- Preferred PhD candidates should be good at programming or maths, and more importantly love doing research.  -->
<!-- For ZJU students, kindly check out my Google Calendar if you wish to have a talk. --></p>

<!-- To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)](http://localhost:4000/vacancies) **!**


We are grateful for funding from Leiden University, [NWO](www.nwo.nl) ([Vidi talent scheme](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme) and the [Frontiers in Nanoscience program](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/science/frontiers-of-nanoscience-nanofront)), and from an [ERC starting grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants). -->
